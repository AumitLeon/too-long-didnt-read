# TDLR.ai: An AI Powered Text Summarizer

A Google Chrome extension that summarizes text using Open AI LLM models.

## ðŸš§ _*Notes*_ ðŸš§
- This project was generated in large part by OpenAI's GPT-4. While I provided the prompts, GPT-4 provided virtually all of the code. I took some creative liberties in a few places and had to make a couple small changes, but this project is almost entirely the product of GPT-4 responding to my prompts asking it to build this extension iteratively.  
- Please make sure you have a valid OpenAI API key to use this extension.
- The extension currently uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model in the API call. Replace it with the appropriate GPT-4 model when broadly available.
